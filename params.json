You don't have to remember those weird class names and litter them all over your HTML when creating different sized columns.\r\n\r\n### How the hell do I use this?!\r\n\r\nIt's dead simple! The [demo](demo.html) page demonstrates how to use this shit. Go on, let that knowledge flow into you. Fuck yeah!\r\n\r\n### How do I import this into my project?\r\n\r\nOnce you have downloaded it you can drop the _columns.scss file into your SCSS folder and toward the top of your main SCSS file write:\r\n\r\n`@import 'columns';`\r\n\r\n**Note:** This will assume both files are at the same directory level.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me, John Ghioca, via twitter at [@jghioca](https://twitter.com/jghioca) or using the form on [john.ghioca.com](http://johnghioca.com/) if you have any questions.
