# Columns

## Do you want to avoid using enormous CSS frameworks in your project just so you can create columns easily?

With this mixin, you don't have to memorise class names that certain frameworks make you use and you don't have to litter them all over your HTML when creating different sized columns.

### How the hell do I use this?!

It's dead simple! The [demo](demo.html) page will give you an explanation.

### How do I import this into my project?

Once you have downloaded it, you can drop the _columns.scss file into your SCSS folder and toward the top of your main SCSS file write:

`@import 'columns';`

**Note:** This will assume both files are at the same directory level. If this is not the case, you will have to update the path accordingly.

Example: `@import 'path/to/columns';`
