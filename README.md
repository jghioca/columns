# Columns

## A super easy way to create columns on your web page without having to load in bulky frameworks on your site.

With this lightweight SCSS mixin library you can easily create columns on your web page without having to include frameworks that have you add class names in your markup just so you can create different sized columns.

### How the hell do I use this?!

It's dead simple! The [demo](demo.html) page will give you an explanation.

### How do I import this into my project?

Once you have downloaded it, you can drop the _columns.scss file into your SCSS folder and toward the top of your main SCSS file write:

`@import 'columns';`

**Note:** This will assume both files are at the same directory level. If this is not the case, you will have to update the path accordingly.

Example: `@import 'path/to/columns';`
